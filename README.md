# Ketje authenticated encryption scheme
This repository contains an implementation of the [Ketje algorithm](https://keccak.team/ketje.html).
This was an assigment from the Cryptography course in Aalto University.
With respect to the original implementation that leverages lookup tables, this version implements all
the steps needed to generate the encrypted payloads. Give it a try!
